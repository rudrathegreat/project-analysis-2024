# Correlating Rainfall Variability to Litter Distributions in Moonee Ponds Creek
## Abstract
There is increasing attention driven to understand the correlations being variability in precipitation and the accumulation of macroplastics in rivers and other water systems. Moonee Ponds Creek is one such water system in south-east Australia, which has seen regular abundance of litter. In this paper, the effects of rainfall variability on the rate of accumulation of four categories of plastics is investigated. From these four categories, Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), Metals (ME) and Other (OT) litter items have seen no correlation between levels of precipitation and the rate of build-up of litter. However, a weak positive correlation between plastics (PL) and levels of rainfall has been identified. Moreover, the abundance of plastics, specifically soft plastics and food wrappers suggests that further attention must be spent on tackling these specific subcategories from entering over-exploited tributaries such as the Moonee Ponds Creek.
